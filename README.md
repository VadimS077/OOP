# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains implementations of the following data structures:

1. Dynamic Array (arrayd)
2. Template Dynamic Array (arrayt)
3. Matrix (matrixs)
4. Rational Numbers(rational)

## Dynamic Array

A dynamic array is a resizable array that can grow or shrink in size during runtime. It is implemented using a static array and reallocating memory when necessary. The implementation involves keeping track of the current size and capacity of the array and reallocating memory when the capacity is exceeded.

## Template Dynamic Array

A template dynamic array is similar to a dynamic array but allows for generic data types to be stored. It is implemented using templates in C++.

## Matrix

A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers or other data types. It is implemented using a static two-dimensional array and supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition.

## Rational Numbers

Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers. They are implemented using a class in C++ that stores the numerator and denominator of the rational number and supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Testing

The pro.test folder contains test cases for each of these data structures to ensure their correct implementation and functionality.
